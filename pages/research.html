	  <h1>Research</h1>
	  <p> Soft materials exhibit many types of disorder, from impure crystals to glasses to elongated chains.  I use numerical simulations to study patterns of disorder and phase changes in a variety of soft systems.  

	  
		<h2> Colloids on Patterned Substrates </h2>

	  <p>
	    Colloids on patterned substrates can form well tailored grain boundaries separating ordered, crystalline regions.  Several of those patterns are shown in the image, consisting of a square patterned substrate of traps, covered with a varying number of colloids annealed to the groundstate.  The image is colored by a Voronoi tessellation, where gray indicates ordered hexagonal crystalline regions (i.e. particles with six neighbors), dark blue are square regions (particles with four neighbors).  Stripes of red and light blue are grain boundaries, indicating particles with either five (light blue) or seven (red) neighbors.  Red more about this fun and fascinating system here:

		<h2> Dynamic Colloidal and Granular Systems </h2>
		<p>
		  As soft matter flows, distinct dynamical regimes form.
		  (coming soon)
		</p>
		
		<h2> Active Matter flowing across disorder </h2>
	  <p> Self-propelling agents consuming energy from the environment are inherently non-equilibrium physical systems.
	    With Pacific University undergraduates,
	    I'm exploring how active matter responses
	    in complex environments.  
	    The onset of swarming
	    in active matter is an
	    order-disorder phase transition that can be detected
	    with statistical measurements of
	    clustering.
	    Biological and synthetic active matter exhibit collective behaviors which are modified by environmental disorder.
	    A herd of sheep clogs while moving through a bottleneck.
	    Free E. coli exhibits run-and-tumble motion,3 but confined E. coli moves by directed hopping in a porous media.
	    Engineered active colloidal rollers transition from collective flow to disordered non-directional motion due to scattered environmental obstacles.

	    <p>
	    In the past, I studied ratchet effects in active matter,
	    including reverse ratchet effects where the active particles
	    had a net backward flow due to collective effects.

		<h2> Machine Learning </h2>
	        <p>
		  How can we predict the onset and characteristics
		  of 
		  non-equilibrium phase transitions?
		  Machine learning algorithms can extract
		  patterns from large datasets by building
		  predictive mathematical models when given
		  the proper data inputs.
		  The intersection of machine learning
		  and statistical mechanics offers promising
		  tools to classify disorder in soft matter.
		  I'm working on new ways to classify dynamical disorded systems, building on the work described in the link below:
